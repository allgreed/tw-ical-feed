## Dev

### Prerequisites

- `direnv` (`nix-env -iA nixpkgs.direnv`)
- [configured direnv shell hook ](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html)
- some form of `make` (`nix-env -iA nixpkgs.gnumake`)

Hint: if something doesn't work because of missing package please add the package to `default.nix` instead of installing it on your computer. Why solve the problem for one if you can solve the problem for all? ;)
